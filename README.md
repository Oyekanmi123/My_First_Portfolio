# My First Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This project showcases my initial foray into web development, featuring a simple yet functional HTML webpage.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two HTML files: `base_index.html` and `index.html`. The `index.html` file is an enhanced version that includes various HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and an interactive image.

## Directory Structure

- `html_basic/`
  - `base_index.html`: A basic HTML file that serves as the initial version of the webpage.
  - `index.html`: The enhanced HTML file showcasing multiple headings and paragraphs with a clickable image.

## Features

- **HTML5 Structure**: The webpage adheres to the HTML5 standards, ensuring compatibility and validity.
- **Content Organization**: Includes various headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) to demonstrate content hierarchy and organization.
- **Clickable Image**: Features an interactive image that links to the official ALX website, allowing users to learn more by clicking the image.
